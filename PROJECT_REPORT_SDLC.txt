==============================================================================
2. SYSTEM DESIGN
==============================================================================

2.1 Architecture Design
- Multi-layered architecture: Controller → Service → Repository → Database
- Microservices-ready design with clear separation of concerns
- RESTful API design following HTTP standards

2.2 Database Design
Multi-Table DynamoDB Structure:
- employees: Employee master data (PK: id)
- departments: Department information (PK: id)
- attendances: Daily attendance records (PK: id)
- payrolls: Payroll computation data (PK: id)
- leave_requests: Leave management (PK: id)

2.3 Entity Relationships
- Employee → Department (Many-to-One via departmentId)
- Employee → Attendance (One-to-Many via employeeId)
- Employee → Payroll (One-to-Many via employeeId)
- Employee → Leave (One-to-Many via employeeCode)

2.4 API Design
REST Endpoints:
- /api/employees/* - Employee operations
- /api/attendance/* - Attendance management
- /api/leaves/* - Leave management
- /api/payroll/* - Payroll operations

2.5 Class Design
Entity Layer:
- EmployeeDynamo, DepartmentDynamo, AttendanceDynamo
- PayrollDynamo, LeaveRequestDynamo
- BaseEntity for common fields

Service Layer:
- EmployeeDynamoService, AttendanceDynamoService
- LeaveDynamoService, PayrollBatchService
- SalaryComputationService

Repository Layer:
- Spring Data DynamoDB repositories
- Custom query methods for business logic

==============================================================================
3. IMPLEMENTATION
==============================================================================

3.1 Development Environment Setup
- Java 24, Spring Boot 2.7.12
- AWS SDK for DynamoDB integration
- Maven for dependency management
- DynamoDB Local for development

3.2 Core Implementation

3.2.1 Entity Implementation
- DynamoDB annotations (@DynamoDBTable, @DynamoDBHashKey)
- BaseEntity with timestamps and ID generation
- Proper getter/setter methods with validation

3.2.2 Repository Implementation
- Spring Data DynamoDB repositories
- Custom finder methods for complex queries
- Bulk operations for performance optimization

3.2.3 Service Implementation
- Business logic separation from controllers
- Transaction management for data consistency
- Error handling and validation

3.2.4 Controller Implementation
- RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP methods
- Request/Response DTOs for data transfer
- Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) configuration

3.3 Key Features Implemented
- Complete CRUD operations for all entities
- Bulk attendance creation for efficiency
- Payroll computation with overtime calculation
- Leave status workflow (Pending → Approved → Processed)
- Employee search by various criteria

3.4 Configuration Management
- Application properties for environment-specific settings
- DynamoDB configuration for local and cloud environments
- Auto-table creation and sample data loading

==============================================================================
4. TESTING
==============================================================================

4.1 Testing Strategy
- Unit Testing: Individual component testing
- Integration Testing: End-to-end workflow testing
- BDD Testing: Behavior-driven development approach

4.2 Test Implementation

4.2.1 Unit Tests (EmployeeDynamoTest)
Test Cases Implemented:
- testEmployeeCreation: Validates employee object creation
- testHashIdGeneration: Ensures unique ID generation
- testTimestamps: Verifies automatic timestamp management
- testFullName: Tests computed full name property
- testSetEmployeeDetails: Validates data setting operations

4.2.2 BDD Tests (PayrollGenerationBDDTest)
Scenarios Implemented:
- Given employee with valid salary → When payroll generated → Then payroll created
- Given employee salary → When computed → Then net pay calculated correctly
- Given payroll generation → When processed → Then pay date set
- Given multiple employees → When batch processed → Then all payrolls generated
- Given overtime hours → When calculated → Then overtime pay computed
- Given payroll status → When updated → Then status transitions work

4.3 Test Results
- Total Test Cases: 12
- Passed: 12 (100%)
- Failed: 0 (0%)
- Code Coverage: High coverage across all layers

4.4 Test Automation
- Maven Surefire plugin for test execution
- Automated test reports generation
- CI/CD integration ready
